	<h2>What is Flutter?</h2>

	<p class="quote">
		<span>Flutter</span> is an open-source framework to create high quality, high-performance mobile applications across mobile operating systems - Android and iOS. It provides a <span>simple, powerful, efficient,</span> and easy to understand SDK to write the mobile application in Google’s own language,<span>Dart</span>.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>Fast Development: </span>Flutter’s hot reload feature helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs. Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine (VM). After the VM updates classes with the new versions of fields and functions, the Flutter framework automatically rebuilds the widget tree, allowing you to quickly view the effects of your changes.
		</li>

		<li><span>Expressive and Flexible UIs: </span>Delight your users with Flutter's built-in beautiful Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-flavor) widgets, rich motion APIs, smooth natural scrolling, and platform awareness.</li>

		<li><span>Native Performance: </span>Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android</li>
	</ul>
